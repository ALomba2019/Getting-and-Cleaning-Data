Code book for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project 'Peer-graded Assigment# Getting and Cleaning UCI HAR Dataset'

See the README.md file of this repository for background information on this data set.

Relevant outputs were generated with the run_analysis.R script, which performs the tasks defined in the Assignment.


Data---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raw data downloaded and unzipped from :

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

UCI HAR Dataset contains two folders: train (X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt) and test (X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt)  datasets, and the following general files:


features.txt| List of all features, with description in the UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt file.

activities.txt| Links the class labels with their activity name.

README.txt| Information on the data included in the datasets, namely transformations performed.


Iddentifiers & variables -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

subject: Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

activity: Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING


Cleaning the data -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following procedures were applied to the source data:

1 - Training and test data sets were merged into one dataset;

2 - The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement;

3, 4 - Variable names were managed so that:

--Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed;

--Initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain, respectively;

-- Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation, respectively;

-- Replaced BodyBody with Body;

5 -From the resulting data set (4), a final tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
